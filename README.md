# Data Analysis Denge in Colombia
by Luis Felipe Duss√°n

## Project Overview

Data Analysis Project on Dengue Cases in Colombian Municipalities
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between environmental conditions, such as temperature, and the incidence of dengue cases in various municipalities in Colombia. By leveraging this data, we aim to uncover insights that can help in predicting and controlling the spread of dengue.

#**Data Sources**
Municipality Data: Information on various municipalities in Colombia, including demographic and geographical data.

Temperature Data: Historical temperature records for each municipality.

Dengue Cases Data: Reported cases of dengue in each municipality over a specified time period.

#**Objectives**
Identify Trends: Analyze trends in dengue cases over time and across different municipalities.

Correlation Analysis: Determine the correlation between temperature variations and the number of dengue cases.

Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast future dengue outbreaks based on environmental conditions.

Visualizations: Create visual representations to illustrate findings and insights.

#**Data Preparation**
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data quality.

Data Integration: Merging datasets from multiple sources to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features that may help in understanding and predicting dengue cases.

Analysis and Insights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

Trend Analysis: Examination of temporal trends in dengue cases.

Correlation Analysis: Statistical analysis to determine the relationship between temperature and dengue cases.

Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating models to predict future dengue outbreaks.

Results
Trends Identified: Key trends in dengue cases across different municipalities.

Correlation Findings: Insights into how temperature variations impact dengue incidence.

Model Performance: Evaluation metrics for the predictive models developed.
