# Text Analysis for Patient Medical History

## Project Overview

This project aims to apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze **patient medical histories** in the form of unstructured text. The goal is to extract useful insights and structured information from medical records to assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

This project uses **machine learning** and **text analysis** methods to process patient records, identify key information such as diagnoses, treatments, and medical conditions, and categorize data for further analysis.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identification of medical terms, diseases, medications, and treatments.
- **Classification**: Categorizing medical history into different classes, such as diagnosis, medication, symptoms, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifying the sentiment in the patientâ€™s description of their health (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **Data Extraction**: Extracting relevant information from raw text for structured analysis.

## Datasets

- **Dataset**: Patient Medical Histories (simulated or real-world anonymized medical datasets)
- **Source**: [Example Dataset or Kaggle (if applicable)]

Example data includes medical records in the following format:
- Patient Name: John Doe
- Age: 45
- Diagnosis: Hypertension, Asthma
- Treatment: Beta-blockers, Inhaler

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for text processing.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **spaCy**: For Named Entity Recognition (NER) and advanced NLP tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: For text classification and machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For deep learning-based NLP models (if applicable).
- **Pandas / NumPy**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualizing analysis results.
